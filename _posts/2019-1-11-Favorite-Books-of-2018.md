title: Favorite Books of 2018
---

In 2017 I set a goal of reading 52 books, and failed with only 31 books.Â In 2018, I was more methodical about accomplishing my goal. I started tracking my books publicly on Goodreads. My train commute from Boston to Providence also provided a lot of extra time for reading (when I probably should have been working instead). My final tally was 76 books in 2018 and you can see the full tally [here](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/11842227) if you are interested.

## Favorite books (in the order that I read them)

* Principles by Ray Dalio
* The Rise and Fall of DODO by Neal Stephenson
* Operation Paperclip by Annie Jacobsen
* Birth of a Theorem By Cedric Villani
* Cinder by Marissa Meyer
* Educated by Tara Westover
* Bad Blood by John Carreyrou
* Born a Crime by Trevor Noah
* Sabriel by Garth Nix
