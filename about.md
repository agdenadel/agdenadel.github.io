Alan DenAdel is a Bioinformatics Scientist at the Allen Institute for Immunology. He recently obtained his Ph.D. in Computer Science and Computational Biology from Brown University, where his research interests were clustering single-cell RNAseq data while controlling for the impact of "data double dipping" and evaluating foundation models in genomics. Prior to attending Brown, Alan worked at Illumina as a bioinformatics scientist. As an undergrad, he majored in mathematics (with minors in statistics and biology) at Pacific Lutheran University; and he also holds an MS in Bioinformatics and Genomics from the University of Oregon.
